Java Stream API (with Examples) - HowToDoInJava
Streams can be defined as a sequence of elements from a source that supports aggregate operations on them. The source here refers to a Collection or Arrays who provides data to a Stream. Stream keeps the order of the data as it is in the source. And aggregate operations or bulk operations are operations which allow us to express common manipulations on those values easily and clearly.
